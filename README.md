  [-] Tip and total bill calculated based on the bill and a tip that can be chosen  
  [-] Tip selector is a UISlider that allows you to choose an integer percentage between 0% and 100%  
  [-] You can split the total bill as many ways as you like using a UIStepper object  
  [-] Structurally, the code uses a common function that calculates all values - this function is called whenever the user changes the bill, tip, or number of splits.  
  [-] Added color coding to the tip percentage to indicate quality of the tip. Red for a low tip, yellow for a mid-range tip, green for a good tip.  
  [-] Added a link to a tipping guide website to help determine the amount you should tip in different situations.
