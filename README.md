  [-] Tip and total bill calculated based on the bill and a tip that can be chosen
  [-] Tip selector is a UISlider that allows you to choose an integer percentage between 0% and 100%
  [-] You can split the total bill as many ways as you like using a UIStepper object
  [-] Structurally, the code uses a common function that calculates all values - this function is called whenever the user changes the bill, tip, or number of splits.
